# Asian Barometer Question Section Boundaries - All Waves

## Purpose
Systematic mapping of thematic question sections across all waves (W1-W6) to ensure accurate crosswalk creation.

## Methodology
- Read questions SEQUENTIALLY within each wave
- Identify section transitions by content shifts
- Note section boundaries (start-end question numbers)
- Compare across waves to find equivalent sections

## Notes on Section Variations

- Question numbers shift across waves even for same content
- Some sections expanded/contracted in different waves
- Must verify section boundaries in EACH wave independently
