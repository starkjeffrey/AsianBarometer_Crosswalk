### **1. PANDEMIC POLITICS: COVID-19 & AUTHORITARIAN ACCEPTANCE**

**Main Research Question:**  
*Did the COVID-19 pandemic increase public acceptance of authoritarian governance in Cambodia?*

**Why This is Strong:**
- Timely and globally relevant (pandemic effects on democracy)
- Cambodia is a critical case (hybrid regime, health crisis)
- Rich variation in COVID impact (87% experienced some impact)
- Clear policy implications

**Specific Hypotheses to Test:**

**H1:** Citizens who experienced greater COVID-19 hardship are more likely to support emergency powers and strong leadership.
- DV: Emergency powers acceptance (q172a-e), Support for strong leader (q129)
- IV: COVID impact severity (q140: 1=no impact to 4=very serious)
- Personal COVID impact (q139a-d: illness, job loss, income loss, education disruption)

**H2:** Trust in government COVID response mediates the relationship between pandemic impact and democratic attitudes.
- DV: Democracy satisfaction (q90), Democracy best system (q128)
- IV: COVID impact (q140)
- Mediator: Trust in COVID information (q141), Government COVID handling (q142)

**H3:** The pandemic-authoritarianism link is stronger among economically vulnerable populations.
- Moderator: Income level (SE14), Economic worry (q161), Income fairness (q163)

**Key Findings Preview:**
- 93% experienced COVID impact (only 72 said "no impact")
- 84% support emergency powers during health crisis
- 75% say government handled pandemic well
- BUT only 23% highly satisfied with democracy

**Target Journals:**
- Journal of Democracy
- Democratization  
- World Politics
